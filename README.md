# HSK 3.0 Study Game
## A Gamified Chinese Vocabulary Flashcard Game

❗📚 Play the game online here: **https://greenants.github.io/HSK-3.0-Study-Game/** 👈

> [!NOTE]  
> When running via a mobile device, some of the functions such as the chinese pronunciations, and mascot animations can get slightly buggy - but overall it should be working fairly smoothly at this point. Running on a desktop browser seems to be the most optimal and minimal bugs.

#### Disclaimer
Let me begin by saying I can't really take credit for this, as it was (practically) 100% generated by AI - and therefore the code is probably a mess. In addition to AI, I used 3rd party assets (see attributions below - as well as txt files in their respective folder) for sounds and images. I may change some of the assets around in the future (I would love to add a different mascot that could fit better with the theme).

#### Purpose
The purpose of this game/flashcard app is to drill Chinese vocabulary in a slightly more fun and entertaining way. I find studying for anything extremely boring and I quickly lose motivation - and I thought this little project might make it a bit easier to study by gamifying it a bit.
I hope someone finds some use for this!

#### Open Source GPL Liscense
If you at all are interested in expanding on this application to make it better, please do! And let me know if you have something you would like added.

#### Adaptations
This app can easily be adapted for other flashcards by simply replacing the JSON files with other content. You could replace the files with another language vocabulary, or your own study materials.
